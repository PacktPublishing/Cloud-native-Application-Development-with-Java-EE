# Cloud native Application Development with Java EE
This is the code repository for [Cloud-Native Application Development with Java EE [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cloud-native-application-development-java-ee-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
In a world of modern business models and digital products the use of monolithic applications run classical infrastructure is just not feasible anymore. Many organizations have already begun resorting to the elasticity of the cloud as it offers them greater agility, availability, resilience and portability.

This video course is a one-stop solution for developers and architects, teaching them to understand the challenges faced in building cloud native applications, using Java EE 8 and some additional well known open-source components and APIs. In combination, these APIs enable you to easily build hyperscale, elastic, loosely coupled, reliable, observable and secure microservices.

Throughout this course, we address the different challenges you need to master to build truly cloud native applications with Java EE. By the end of this course you will be equipped with enough knowledge and practical experience to get your next cloud-native Java EE microservices up-and-running in no time, and with ease.

## What will you learn

This course will be your guide to building cloud-native applications using Java EE 8. Throughout this course, you will learn how to address and solve the different challenges you are faced with when building truly cloud-native applications with Java EE. It is packed with step-by-step instructions and realistic examples that are directly applicable in practice. The different sections of this course focus on the important topics and challenges of cloud-native application development such as communication, resiliency, state handling, and observability, and how these can be addressed using the latest Java EE 8 APIs.

1.	Design and build cloud native applications using Java EE 8.
2.	Deploy and run Java EE 8 microservices using Docker and Kubernetes
3.	Build robust and easily consumable REST APIs with JAX-RS and MicroProfile OpenAPI
4.	Build resilient service clients using circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts and retries
5.	Develop loosely coupled, message-driven microservices with JMS and JSON-P
6.	Implement configurability with Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets using MicroProfile Config
7.	Add and implement service monitoring with Metrics and MicroProfile Health
8.	Implement service call tracing with MicroProfile OpenTracing
9.	Secure your microservices with BASIC Auth and JSON Web Tokens
